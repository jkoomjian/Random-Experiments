Performance Improvement Ideas:

Network:
* use a CDN
* use sprites, concatenate js, css, to have as few assets as possible
* use browser caching
* add defer to <script>
* put non-necessary css <link> at bottom of page
* use HTTP2 (then include your assets seperately)
* replace images w/svg sprites
* avoid redirects
* gzip assets

Assets:
* concatenate JS into one file and compress
* concatenate CSS into one file and compress
* optimize images
* generate various image sizes, use media queries, srcset, or <picture> to only include the appropriate image

Rendering:
* doctype set <!DOCTYPE html>
* valid html, proper encoding: <meta charset="utf-8">
* use csstriggers.com to minimize layout, painting, compositing the browser has to do during animations
* animated elements should be out of flow
* don't run animations when not necessary, or on too many elements

JS:
* ensure any processing is put on the event queue, not done syncrounously
* for long-running processes, use webworkers, or break the process into smaller pieces and chain them together with setTimeout()

Other:
* use google page speed insites
