Peer dependencies
https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/

In npm if 2 dependencies both require the same dependencies, but different versions, npm will install 2 copies of the dependency (one of each version) This is the tree diagram in npm
Tools like ruby bundler don't do this - they only allow 1 version of a dependency globally.
Npm's approach is simpler to get running, but can cause subtle problems.
Ex. if 2 different libraries both include react, a react component built with 1 version of react might be passed to a part of react from the different library. This could blow up.
Peer dependencies effectively tell npm to use the bundler approach for the peer dependency - there will be 1 canonical version of the dependency which must work for every package

npm ls
// view global modules
npm list -g --depth 0

Node repl
// To see node module path in the repl, use
> module

Put common global modules in /Users/jonathank/.node_modules
By default npm will try to load them in ~/.node_modules/node_modules, so you have to move them
