A simple project to play around with Web Animation API

+* extend x towards legos, until legos are on xplane
+* for now leave everything on x plane
+* try the degree idea - match the axis to the angle which most closely matches an axis on the space
+* top two axis's?

* angle
** always returns x,y on first loading
** tracks calls, calculates over distance if on z axis
** moves lego back, goes to z

* sketchup model - hold on to z axis for a while


* fix the x,y so they work after translateZ is applied
* drag end
* move legos to axis?
* stacking

* holding down mouse wheel orbits
* add translate with shift + mouse
* zoom - +/-
