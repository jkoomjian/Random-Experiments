Description:
    Stubs out a new portlet and its views. Pass the portlet name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. By default, portlets includes a Name (String) and template (Template Editor)
    attributes, so do not specify them.

    This generates a portlet class in app/portlets, a form in app/view/portlets and
    a default view to render the portlet in app/view/portlets, and a unit test in
    test/unit/portlets.
    
    The name you supply will have "portlet" added to it, much the same way controllers work.

Example:
    `rails generate cms:portlet find_top_x_articles number_to_show:integer description:string`

        A portlet to display a specific number of articles, as specified in the admin UI.
            Portlet:            app/portlets/find_top_x_articles_portlet.rb
            Helper:             app/portlets/helpers/find_top_x_articles_portlet_helper.rb
            Form View:          app/views/portlets/find_top_x_articles/_form.html.erb
            Default Template:   app/views/portlets/find_top_x_articles/render.html.erb
            Unit Test:          test/unit/portlets/find_top_x_articles_portlet_test.rb

        The _form.html.erb will have text_fields for name, number_to_show and description, as
        well as a template_editor for template.
